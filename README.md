# Predicting house rents in Madrid

### About this project
I completed this project in October 2023. It was my first project using Python and Machine Learning libraries.
The process involved several key steps:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: 
   - Conducted to understand the distribution and relationships of various variables.

2. **Data Manipulation and Data Visualization**: 
   - Removed redundant variables.
   - Handled missing values.
   - Outlier detection and removal.
   - Correlation Heatmap

3. **Modeling**: 
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Impact Encoding
   - Standard Scaling of features
   - Implemented a Linear Regression model.

### Model Performance
